                        White is often associated with purity, cleanliness, and simplicity.
                        Wearing white clothing symbolizes the intention to cultivate
                        a pure and untainted mind during the retreat. It reflects
                        a commitment to inner cleanliness and the pursuit of spiritual
                        purity.

                        White clothing is considered neutral and universal. By having
                        everyone wear white, regardless of their background or social
                        status, it promotes a sense of equality and unity among participants.
                        It serves as a visual reminder that, in the spiritual context,
                        everyone is equal and connected.

                        White clothing is generally simple and less likely to be
                        distracting. During retreats, the emphasis is often on turning
                        inward, reducing external stimuli, and fostering an environment
                        conducive to meditation and contemplation. White attire aligns
                        with this goal by minimizing visual distractions.

                        Wearing white enhances one's energy and aura. It is thought
                        to promote a sense of lightness and openness, creating a
                        conducive atmosphere for spiritual practices.

                        In practical terms, white clothing reflects sunlight and
                        helps keep the body cool, especially in warm climates. This
                        can be important during meditation retreats where participants
                        may spend extended periods in contemplative practice.

                        White clothing is often associated with simplicity. Wearing
                        simple, unadorned white attire during a retreat may symbolize
                        a commitment to simplicity in lifestyle and a temporary detachment
                        from worldly concerns.
